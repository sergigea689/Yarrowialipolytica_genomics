# Yarrowialipolytica_genomics

## Overview

This repository contains genomic and phenotypic data analyses for *Yarrowia lipolytica*, including population structure, genotype-phenotype associations, phylogenetic reconstruction, and other relevant genomic analyses.

## Repository structure

- `Gene content/` — Analysis of copy number variants and accessory genome.
- `Genotype-phenotype association/` — Scripts and results linking genotypes to phenotypes, with special focus on growth in acetate.
- `Phenotypic analysis/` — Phenotypic analysis, including, heatmap representation, PERMANOVA analysis, phylogenetic signal calculation and boxplot representation.
- `Phylogenetic reconstruction_Yarrowia_clade/` — Pipeline including the annotation of assemblies, search for orthologues, alignments and phylogenetic tree representation.
- `Ploidy estimation/` — Data and scripts for ploidy estimation.
- `Population Structure/` — Analyses on population genomics, including PCA, FineStructure, ADMIXTURE and genetic diversity parameters.
- `Read processing and variant calling/` — Raw data processing and variant identification workflows.



## Usage

Here you will find pipelines and workflow to analyse genomic and phenotypic data and recreate figures in the corresponding manuscript. These are not scripts or automatic analysis
